      <h2>Infinite Wiki</h2>
      <p>
        Infinite Wiki is an interactive word exploration game where players dive into an endless web of definitions.
        Starting from a single word, players can click on any word within its definition to reveal a new definition,
        continuing the chain of discovery indefinitely. It’s a playful and educational experience that highlights the
        interconnected nature of language and meaning.
      </p>

        The game was created on August 2, 2025, by two young developers, Five and Lalaulune, during their summer vacation in London.
        It was a slightly grey day when the idea struck Five like a miracle—as if the clouds had delivered it directly to him.
        Inspired by the idea of language as a living network, they started prototyping Infinite Wiki right away.
        What began as a spontaneous spark quickly turned into a creative way to explore how words lead to other words,
        sparking curiosity with every click.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're here to learn, explore, or simply get lost in definitions, Infinite Wiki invites you to start with one word—and keep going.

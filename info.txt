Infinite Wiki is an interactive word exploration game where players dive into an endless web of definitions. Starting from a single word, players can click on any word within its definition to reveal a new definition, continuing the chain of discovery indefinitely. It’s a playful and educational experience that highlights the interconnected nature of language and meaning. The game was created on August 2, 2025, by two young developers, Five and Lalaulune, during their summer vacation in London. It was a slightly grey day when the idea struck Five like a miracle—as if the clouds had delivered it directly to him. Inspired by the idea of language as a living network, they started prototyping Infinite Wiki right away. What began as a spontaneous spark quickly turned into a creative way to explore how words lead to other words, sparking curiosity with every click. Whether you're here to learn, explore, or simply get lost in definitions, Infinite Wiki invites you to start with one word—and keep going.
